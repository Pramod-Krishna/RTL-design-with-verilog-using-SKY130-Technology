## **_Introduction to Verilog RTL design and and synthesis_**
Here **_iverilog_** is the simulator used. Simulator basically looks for changes in input, upon which output is evaluated. If there are no changes in the input, output won't be evaluated. _iverilog_ takes **_design_** and **_testbench_** as inputs. The output is a **_vcd file_** and the _waveforms_ can be viewed by using the **_gtkwave_** command.
